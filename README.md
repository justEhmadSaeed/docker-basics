# DOCKER BASICS üê≥

Docker is great!

So, why not add it to our skillset?

Docker provides a streamlined and efficient way to package, distribute, and run applications, making deployment easy.

I'm documenting my journey of learning and implementing Docker in my daily work.

Why Docker, you ask? Here are a few benefits that got me hooked:

1.  Portability: Docker containers run consistently across various environments, from local development to production servers.
2.  Isolation: Each container encapsulates dependencies, reducing conflicts and ensuring seamless collaboration among team members.
3.  Resource Efficiency: Docker enables lightweight, resource-efficient containers, optimizing server usage and scalability.
4.  Rapid Deployment: With Docker, deploying applications becomes lightning-fast, thanks to the containerization magic.

Learning Docker isn't just about hopping on the latest tech trend ‚Äì it's about staying relevant and mastering a tool that transforms the software development landscape.

### Lessons:

1.  [Containerize a simple node app](/hello-docker/)
2.  [Containerize a React app and publish Docker image](/react-docker/)
3.  [Automating and Composing Docker](/compose-docker/)
4.  [Docker Compose Watch (live changes) for a MERN App](/mern-docker/)
5.  [Containerize a Next.js App](/next-docker/)
