# Automate Dockerization

In this lesson, we will learn about:

-   How to automate the containerization process
-   [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)
-   [How to use Docker Compose](#how-to-use-docker-compose)

Well, it might be hard for us to write so lengthy commands repeatedly. How about automating all of that stuff?

## Docker Compose

In the world of Docker, managing multiple containers and their configurations can be like coordinating a symphony of instruments.

Think of Docker Compose as the musical score (configuration file) that specifies which instruments (containers) to include, how they should harmonize (networking), and the tempo (dependencies) at which they should play.

Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container applications. You describe your applicationâ€™s services, networks, and volumes in a single docker-compose.yml file, and Docker Compose takes care of creating and managing the containers based on that composition.

For instance, if your application includes a web server, a database, and a caching service, Docker Compose lets you define these services and their interactions in one file. When you want to start your application, a simple command like docker-compose up directs the orchestra, and all the containers start playing together in harmony.

## How To Use Docker Compose

1. Create a new React project. Enter the docker initialization command in the project directory.

```bash
docker init
```

2. It will create `.dockerignore`, `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` files in the root directory. We are already familiar with the first two files. Let's replace the `Dockerfile` from [Our React Docker Project](/react-docker/Dockerfile).

3. The previous command to run React Docker can be translated in the `compose.yaml` syntax as such:

```bash
# previous command
docker run -p 5173:5173 -v "$(pwd):/app" -v /app/node_modules react-docker
```

```bash
# compose.yaml
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - 5173:5173
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

4. Now, we just need a simple command to build and run the container. It's that simple now. Isn't that great?

```bash
docker compose up
```
